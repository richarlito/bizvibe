## GTM Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Local First**: Start in one market, prove the model, then expand
2. **Supply Before Demand**: Get businesses on board before major consumer push
3. **Quality Over Quantity**: Better to have 100 active businesses than 1,000 dormant
4. **Community-Driven**: Leverage local networks and relationships
5. **Data-Driven Iteration**: Test, measure, optimize continuously
