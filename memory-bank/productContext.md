# BizVibe - Product Context

## Why BizVibe Exists

### The Problem Landscape

**The Discovery Gap**
Today's consumers, especially Gen Z and Millennials, are conditioned by TikTok and Instagram to consume information through short, engaging video content. Yet when they want to discover local businesses, they're forced back into text-heavy, static interfaces like Google Maps, Yelp, or Facebook Pages. This creates a fundamental disconnect between how people prefer to consume content and how businesses present themselves.

**The SMB Marketing Crisis**
Small and medium businesses face an impossible choice:
1. **Pay to play**: Facebook/Instagram ads require significant budgets and expertise
2. **Create content**: Video production is expensive and time-consuming
3. **Hope for organic**: Social algorithms deprioritize business content
4. **Stay invisible**: Many businesses simply don't have an effective online presence

**The Trust Deficit**
Stock photos, generic descriptions, and potentially fake reviews make it hard for consumers to get an authentic feel for a business. Video provides an unfiltered window into who businesses really are.

### Market Opportunity

The social commerce market is projected to reach $1.2 trillion by 2025. TikTok Shop has proven that users will purchase directly from video content. However, TikTok serves global brands and viral products—there's no dedicated platform for local commerce.

BizVibe captures this whitespace: **local-first, video-native commerce**.
